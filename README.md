## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

You need to clone this repository via SSH or HTTPS link provided by GitHub using terminal :
```
git clone git@github.com:nehasadhvi/DevConnector.git
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/nehasadhvi/DevConnector.git
```

Now, after succesfully cloning the repo, you need to install all the dependencies on your local computer for which you need to use the following command in main folder to download back-end dependencies as well as inside "client" folder to download front-end dependencies :
```
npm install
```

Now, you are all set to run the application from your local machine. To run the application, go to terminal and use the following command and the app will start running on available port :
```
npm run dev
```

This will make your application run on PORT 3000, if in use, on next available port.

Happy Dev-Connecting ! ;)
